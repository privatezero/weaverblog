One of the primary goals of my project at CUNY TV is to implement a system of perceptual hashing that can be integrated into out archival workflows.  Perceptual hashing is a method of identifying similar content using automated analysis; the goal being to eliminate the (often impossible) necessity of having a person look at every item one-by-one to make content comparisons.
