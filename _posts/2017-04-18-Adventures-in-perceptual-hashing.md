One of the primary goals of my project at CUNY TV is to prototype a system of perceptual hashing that can be integrated into our archival workflows. Perceptual hashing is a method of identifying similar content using automated analysis; the goal being to eliminate the (often impossible) necessity of having a person look at every item one-by-one to make comparisons. Perceptual hashes function in a similar sense to standard checksums, except instead of comparing hashes to establish similarity of bits, they establish similarity of content as would be perceived by a viewer or listener.

There are many examples of perceptual hashing in use that you might already have encountered.  If you have ever used Shazzam to identify a song, then you have used perceptual hashing. When you encounter a video on Youtube that has had its audio track muted due to copyright violation, it was probably detected via perceptual hashing.
